    <input type="checkbox" id="clear_all_intervals"/> Clear all intervals after page load 

    <i>Some webpages uses setInterval functions to do jobs like invoking console.clear every some ms.
      Not only it makes console empty and unusable for debugging purposes (Except in Chrome by ticking 'Preserve logs') but it also slowdown your PC.
      This is because the same function is invoked an insane amount of times as long as the page is running, each some ms. CPU would be 98% busy executing this code.
      This option allows you to STOP these functions.
      This option works ONLY in VideoGaze-injected webpages. That means that other webpages will not be affected.
    
      Default value: <b>disabled</b>.

      BE CAREFUL! Some websites are coded in their logic with "interval functions". Disable this if these websites do not work properly!</i>
